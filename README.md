# Cryptocoin: Making a humble cryptocurrency

## Motivation

As a high schooler, I made a few school assignments. One of that assigments, was make a science divulgation. Me and my fellow group members decided to make the work about cryptocurrency (more specific, about bitcoin), being a hot subject nowadays. My part was the more computer science related topics, the explanation of how bitcoin works. I was amazed of how everthing worked, the subtle details of the subject. I lost myself in the topics, escaping a little of the starting point, the science divulgation. We apresented the work in a podcast format, but unfortunately the podcast is all in portuguese. In the end of the work I decided that a wanted to make my own cryptocurrency. So started learning python, and now I'm making this project.
