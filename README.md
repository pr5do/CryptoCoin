# Cryptocoin

![CI](https://github.com/pr5do/cryptocoin/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)


## Description

An application intended for me to learn how a cryptocurrency works under the hood. Also, I wanted to create a cryptocurrency to help with small business and make something more acessible for everbody. With my other projects, I wanted to use this project as a link and a way to instigate people about this (if I'm making a E-commerce, for example, I can make this cryptocurrency a way of payment).

## Installation

### Step 1: Install the dependencies: 

Type "pip install -r requirements.txt" on our terminal

### Step 2: Run the source/view/main.py file
